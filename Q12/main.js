/*Q12:Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11,
but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them.
The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be
personalized with the person’s name.*/
var friendNames = ["Sana", "Any", "Umaima", "Yusra"];
friendNames.forEach(function (friendNames) { return console.log("Hello ".concat(friendNames, " How are you")); });
